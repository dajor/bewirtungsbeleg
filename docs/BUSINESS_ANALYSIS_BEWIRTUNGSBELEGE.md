# Business Analysis: Bewirtungsbelege (German Hospitality Receipts)

## Executive Summary
Bewirtungsbelege are critical tax documents in German accounting that require precise handling due to complex tax regulations. Only 70% of entertainment expenses are tax-deductible, with specific rules varying between customer and employee entertainment.

## Legal Framework

### Tax Deductibility (§4 Abs. 5 Nr. 2 EStG)
- **70% Rule**: Only 70% of reasonable entertainment expenses are deductible as business expenses
- **30% Non-deductible**: Remaining 30% must be booked as non-deductible operating expenses
- **BMF Guidelines**: Federal Ministry of Finance provides specific requirements for receipt validity

### Required Documentation (§162 AO)
Every Bewirtungsbeleg must contain:
1. **Place and Date** of entertainment
2. **Participants** (names and business relationship)
3. **Reason/Occasion** for entertainment
4. **Amount and breakdown** of expenses
5. **Signature** of the host

## Accounting Categories

### 1. Geschäftliche Bewirtung (Customer/External Entertainment)
**Purpose**: Entertainment of customers, suppliers, business partners, or prospects
**Complexity**: HIGH - Requires up to 6 separate booking entries

#### Booking Structure (SKR03/SKR04):
```
Account SKR03 | SKR04 | Description                  | Deductibility | VAT Rate
4650   | 6640  | Entertainment expenses (70%) | Deductible    | Variable
4654   | 6644  | Entertainment expenses (30%) | Non-deductible| Variable
```

#### Detailed Booking Entries:
1. **Meals (Speisen)**
   - 70% → Account 4650/6640 with 7% VAT
   - 30% → Account 4654/6644 with 7% VAT

2. **Beverages (Getränke)**
   - 70% → Account 4650/6640 with 19% VAT
   - 30% → Account 4654/6644 with 19% VAT

3. **Tips (Trinkgeld)**
   - 70% → Account 4650/6640 (no VAT)
   - 30% → Account 4654/6644 (no VAT)

### 2. Betriebliche Bewirtung (Employee Entertainment)
**Purpose**: Internal company events, employee meals, team meetings
**Complexity**: MEDIUM - Requires up to 3 booking entries

#### Characteristics:
- 100% deductible if reasonable and business-related
- Simpler booking process
- Different account numbers than customer entertainment
- May trigger wage tax implications if excessive

## VAT Treatment

### Reduced VAT Rate (7%)
- Food items (meals)
- Take-away food
- Applies to both eat-in and take-out since COVID-19 temporary measures

### Standard VAT Rate (19%)
- All beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic)
- Service charges (when separately stated)

### No VAT
- Tips/gratuities (Trinkgeld)
- Foreign receipts may have different VAT rates

## Practical Booking Example

### Scenario: Restaurant Bill €150.00
```
Restaurant Receipt Total: €150.00
- Meals: €80.00 (7% VAT = €5.23)
- Drinks: €50.00 (19% VAT = €7.98)
- Tip: €20.00 (no VAT)
```

#### Customer Entertainment Booking:
```
1. Meals 70%:    €56.00 + €3.66 VAT → 4650/6640
2. Meals 30%:    €24.00 + €1.57 VAT → 4654/6644
3. Drinks 70%:   €35.00 + €5.59 VAT → 4650/6640
4. Drinks 30%:   €15.00 + €2.39 VAT → 4654/6644
5. Tip 70%:      €14.00             → 4650/6640
6. Tip 30%:      €6.00              → 4654/6644
```

## Common Compliance Issues

### 1. Missing Information
- Incomplete participant lists
- Missing business purpose
- Lack of detailed receipt breakdown

### 2. Calculation Errors
- Incorrect 70/30 split
- Wrong VAT rates applied
- Mathematical rounding errors

### 3. Documentation Failures
- Handwritten additions not signed
- Missing original receipts
- Delayed documentation (must be timely)

### 4. Unreasonable Expenses
- Excessive amounts per person
- Luxury venues without justification
- Frequency concerns (daily entertainment of same client)

## Digital Processing Requirements

### OCR Extraction Must Capture:
1. **Header Information**
   - Restaurant name and address
   - Date and time
   - Receipt/invoice number

2. **Line Items**
   - Individual meals with prices
   - Beverages listed separately
   - Clear VAT rate indicators

3. **Totals**
   - Subtotals by VAT rate
   - VAT amounts
   - Total amount
   - Tip (if included)

### Classification Logic:
```
IF participants include external parties THEN
    Category = "Geschäftliche Bewirtung"
    Apply 70/30 split
ELSE IF only employees present THEN
    Category = "Betriebliche Bewirtung"
    100% potentially deductible
END IF
```
