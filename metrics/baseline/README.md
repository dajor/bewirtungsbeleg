# Performance Baseline Documentation

**Captured:** October 11, 2025 at 19:54:32 CEST
**Git Branch:** `dev`
**Git Commit:** `aff11dc`

## Overview

This baseline was captured before implementing any performance optimizations as part of the comprehensive performance improvement plan. This serves as the reference point for measuring the impact of all future optimizations.

## Key Metrics

### Build Artifacts
- **Total .next directory:** 571 MB
- **Largest JavaScript chunks:**
  - 994-f9c4c4e43dd43a0f.js: 220 KB (Mantine UI + dependencies)
  - fd9d1056-2bd5508b361313ca.js: 169 KB
  - 269-261eb07625da4c6f.js: 157 KB
  - Framework bundle: 137 KB

### Dependencies
- **node_modules size:** 1.0 GB
- **Total packages:** 68 packages

### Source Code
- **src directory size:** 3.3 MB
- **TypeScript files:** 174 files
- **Main form component:** 1,638 lines (src/app/components/BewirtungsbelegForm.tsx)

## Identified Performance Issues

Based on the performance analysis, the following issues were identified:

### üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix First)
1. **Monolithic Form Component (1,638 lines)**
   - File: src/app/components/BewirtungsbelegForm.tsx
   - Impact: 200-500ms slower initial render
   - Solution: Split into smaller components

2. **Missing React.memo**
   - All components render on every parent state change
   - Impact: Unnecessary re-renders throughout the app
   - Solution: Add React.memo to pure components

### üü° High Priority
3. **No Lazy Loading**
   - All components load upfront
   - Impact: Slower initial page load (2-3 seconds)
   - Solution: Implement dynamic imports with next/dynamic

4. **Large Unoptimized Images**
   - Not using next/image optimization
   - Impact: Slower page load (1-2 seconds per image)
   - Solution: Replace with next/image

### üü¢ Medium Priority
5. **No API Response Caching**
   - Repeated API calls fetch same data
   - Impact: Unnecessary network requests
   - Solution: Implement Redis caching

6. **Inefficient State Management**
   - Deep object comparisons on every render
   - Impact: CPU usage 10-20% higher
   - Solution: useMemo + useCallback optimization

## Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
- Add React.memo to components
- Add useMemo for expensive operations
- Implement lazy loading with next/dynamic
- Optimize images with next/image

**Expected Improvements:**
- Initial load: -2-3 seconds
- Re-render time: -50-70%
- Bundle size: -15-20%

### Phase 2: API & Infrastructure (2-3 hours)
- Parallel OCR processing
- OpenAI client singleton pattern
- Redis caching for API responses
- Remove unused dependencies

**Expected Improvements:**
- OCR processing: -50%
- PDF generation: -60%
- API response time: -40%

### Phase 3: Component Refactoring (3-4 hours)
- Split BewirtungsbelegForm into 8 smaller components
- Optimize state management per component
- Add proper loading states

**Expected Improvements:**
- Form render time: -60%
- Code maintainability: +100%
- Developer experience: Much better

## Testing Strategy

Before each optimization:
1. Capture current metrics: `./scripts/capture-baseline-simple.sh`
2. Save as comparison point: `./scripts/save-baseline.sh`
3. Make the optimization changes
4. Capture new metrics: `./scripts/capture-baseline-simple.sh metrics/current`
5. Compare results: `./scripts/compare-metrics.sh`
6. Verify no test failures
7. If tests pass and metrics improve ‚Üí commit
8. If tests fail ‚Üí rollback immediately

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Baseline captured
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Implement Phase 1 optimizations (React.memo, useMemo, lazy loading)
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Test and compare metrics
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Proceed to Phase 2 if Phase 1 successful
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Continue until all optimizations complete

## Notes

- **Authentication is currently broken** (GitHub Issue #871)
  - The `/me/login` endpoint at dev.auth.docbits.com is non-functional
  - Login tests will fail until the auth team fixes the backend
  - Skip auth tests during performance optimization

- **Test Suite Status:**
  - Working tests: 9 E2E tests (non-auth)
  - Broken tests: 2 auth tests (known issue)
  - Unit tests: All passing
